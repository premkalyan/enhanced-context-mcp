## Context Sources

From Discussion: Project name, features, personas, tech preferences, scale expectations, budget, timeline, compliance
From WAMA: Enterprise patterns, cloud best practices, security standards, performance optimization, scalability patterns
From VISHKAR: Organization context, existing infrastructure, team expertise, regulatory requirements

## Generation Guidelines

### Architecture Summary
10-step process: Executive summary (2-3 para) → System overview (components, interactions) → Key decisions (5-8 with rationale) → Tech stack (language, frameworks, DB, cloud) → Scalability (horizontal/vertical, LB, caching) → Security (auth, encryption, API security) → Performance (targets, optimization) → Deployment (cloud, services, topology) → Monitoring (logging, metrics, alerting) → Future (extensibility, evolution)
Output: 1000-1500 words, technical/authoritative tone, markdown with clear headings

### System Architecture Diagram
Use Mermaid graph TB/LR. Create layers: Client → API Gateway → Business Logic → Data. Show external services, auth boundaries. Use subgraphs for grouping. Label connections with protocols. Use descriptive names.
Output: 8-15 components, clear/hierarchical, valid Mermaid

### Component Diagram
Break down major components into modules. Show dependencies, shared libraries, API interfaces, reusable components. Use consistent naming.
Output: 10-20 modules, detailed but not overwhelming, valid Mermaid

### Flow Diagrams
Create 3-5 sequences: Authentication, Core Feature(s), Error Handling. Show all participants (User, Frontend, API, Services, DB). Clear steps. Success/failure paths. Note async operations.
Output: 3-5 diagrams, clear sequence, valid Mermaid

### Database Schema
Create ER with all entities. Show relationships (1:1, 1:N, M:N). Include PK, FK, UK. Note indexes. Add data types for key fields. Include audit fields (created_at, updated_at).
Output: 5-15 tables, normalized (3NF), valid Mermaid ER

### Deployment Architecture
Show cloud topology. Include: Edge (CDN, DNS) → Application (LB, Compute) → Data (DB, Cache, Storage). Add monitoring/logging. Show network boundaries, security zones, auto-scaling, backup/DR.
Output: 10-20 cloud services, production-ready, valid Mermaid

### IaC Plan
Recommend IaC tool with rationale. Provide directory structure. Show module organization. Explain environment separation. Include sample configs. Document deployment procedures. Integrate CI/CD.
Output: 500-800 words + code samples, practical/actionable, markdown

### 7. IaC Plan
```markdown
# IaC Plan

## Tool: Terraform
Rationale: Cloud-agnostic, large community, strong AWS support, state management (S3+DynamoDB), plan/apply workflow

## Directory Structure
```
infrastructure/terraform/
  modules/ (networking, compute, database, storage, security, monitoring)
  environments/ (dev, staging, prod)
  global/ (route53, cloudfront, iam)
```

## Environments

Dev: 1 task, db.t3.micro, single Redis node (~$92/mo)
Staging: 2 tasks, db.t3.small Multi-AZ, 2 Redis nodes (~$200/mo)
Prod: 3 tasks, db.t3.medium Multi-AZ, 3 Redis nodes (~$525/mo)

## Sample Config
```hcl
resource "aws_ecs_service" "api" {
  name = "${var.environment}-app-api"
  cluster = aws_ecs_cluster.main.id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.api.arn
  desired_count = var.desired_count
  launch_type = "FARGATE"
  load_balancer {
    target_group_arn = var.target_group_arn
    container_name = "api"
    container_port = 3000
  }
}
```

## Deployment
1. terraform init -backend-config="bucket=app-state"
2. terraform validate
3. terraform plan -out=tfplan
4. terraform apply tfplan

## CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- On PR: terraform plan for all envs
- On main push: terraform apply for prod (with approval gate)
```

## Quality Standards
- Completeness: All 7 artifacts, no placeholders, comprehensive coverage
- Accuracy: Valid Mermaid syntax, technically sound, realistic estimates, best practices
- Clarity: Clear names, logical organization, easy diagrams, documented rationale
- Consistency: Naming conventions, unified styles, coherent tech stack
- Professionalism: Enterprise-grade, production-ready, suitable for stakeholders
