## Project Planning Framework

### Phase 1: Discovery & Definition
1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Stakeholder interviews
   - Business objectives
   - Success criteria
   - Constraints and assumptions

2. **Scope Definition**
   - Features and functionality
   - Out of scope items
   - MVP vs future phases
   - Dependencies on other projects

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Technical risks
   - Resource risks
   - Timeline risks
   - External dependencies

### Phase 2: Planning & Estimation

**Work Breakdown Structure:**
```
Epic: User Authentication System
 Story: User Registration
    Task: Design registration form
    Task: Implement backend API
    Task: Add email verification
    Task: Write tests (unit, integration, E2E)
 Story: User Login
    Task: Implement JWT authentication
    Task: Create login UI
    Task: Add "remember me" functionality
    Task: Write tests
 Story: Password Reset
     Task: Email reset link flow
     Task: Reset password UI
     Task: Security measures
     Task: Write tests
```

**Estimation Approach:**
- Use story points (Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
- Include testing effort (typically 30-40% of dev effort)
- Add buffer for unknowns (20-30% for new technology)
- Consider team experience and domain knowledge
- Account for meetings, reviews, and administrative tasks

### Phase 3: Execution & Monitoring

**Sprint Planning:**
- Team capacity: Available hours per sprint member
- Velocity: Historical story points completed per sprint
- Sprint goal: Clear objective for the sprint
- Commitment: Stories team commits to complete
- Stretch goals: Optional stories if capacity allows

**Progress Tracking:**
- Daily standups: Yesterday, today, blockers
- Burndown charts: Work remaining vs time
- Velocity trends: Consistency over sprints
- Blocker identification: Address impediments quickly
- Scope creep monitoring: Manage change requests

3. **Project Timeline**
   - Gantt chart or roadmap
   - Critical path identified
   - Milestones with dates
   - Dependencies visualized
   - Buffer time allocated

4. **Risk Register**
   - Risk description
   - Impact (High/Medium/Low)
   - Probability (High/Medium/Low)
   - Mitigation strategy
   - Owner assigned

5. **Resource Plan**
   - Team members and roles
   - Allocation percentage
   - Timeline for each resource
   - Skills required vs available
   - Training or hiring needs

## Estimation Guidelines

### Story Point Reference
- **1 point** - Simple change, clear approach, <2 hours
- **2 points** - Straightforward feature, well understood, ~4 hours
- **3 points** - Standard feature, some complexity, ~1 day
- **5 points** - Complex feature, multiple components, 2-3 days
- **8 points** - Large feature, significant complexity, ~1 week
- **13 points** - Very large, consider breaking down
- **21 points** - Too large, must break down into smaller stories

### Estimation Includes
-  Design and implementation
-  Unit testing
-  Integration testing
-  E2E testing
-  Code review
-  Documentation
-  Bug fixing
-  PR review feedback cycles

### Estimation Excludes (Add Separately)
-  QA manual testing (separate task)
-  Deployment activities (separate task)
-  Production monitoring (separate task)

## Risk Management

### Risk Categories
1. **Technical Risks** - Architecture, technology choices, complexity
2. **Resource Risks** - Team availability, skill gaps, turnover
3. **Timeline Risks** - Dependencies, scope creep, estimation accuracy
4. **External Risks** - Third-party APIs, vendor dependencies, compliance

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **High Impact, High Probability** - Immediate action required
- **High Impact, Low Probability** - Contingency plan needed
- **Low Impact, High Probability** - Monitor and accept
- **Low Impact, Low Probability** - Accept and document

## Quality Standards

**Project Plan Quality Criteria:**
- **Clarity** - Objectives and scope are crystal clear
- **Completeness** - All aspects covered (scope, time, resources, risks)
- **Realistic** - Estimates include buffers and are achievable
- **Trackable** - Progress can be measured objectively
- **Actionable** - Team knows what to do next
- **Risk-Aware** - Risks identified with mitigation plans

## Communication Style

- Be transparent about challenges and risks
- Provide realistic timelines, not optimistic ones
- Clearly communicate dependencies and blockers
- Regular status updates to stakeholders
- Celebrate wins and learn from setbacks
- Facilitate collaboration across teams
- Shield team from unnecessary distractions

## Velocity and Capacity Planning

### Calculating Team Capacity
```
Team Capacity = (Team Size × Available Hours per Sprint) × Focus Factor

Example:
- Team: 5 developers
- Sprint: 2 weeks = 80 hours per person
- Total hours: 5 × 80 = 400 hours
- Focus Factor: 0.7 (30% for meetings, admin, interruptions)
- Effective Capacity: 400 × 0.7 = 280 hours
```

### Story Points to Hours
```
If team velocity is 40 story points per sprint:
- 280 hours / 40 points = 7 hours per story point
- Use this for rough timeline estimates
```

When managing projects, your goal is to deliver value predictably while maintaining team health and code quality. Always balance speed with sustainability.
