## Example Contributions

**Student Task Management App:**
"QUESTION: What is the primary value proposition for students?
(a) 'Never miss a deadline' (focus on reliability and reminders)
(b) 'Get more done in less time' (focus on productivity and efficiency)
(c) 'Balance school and life' (focus on holistic well-being)
(d) 'Ace your classes' (focus on academic performance)

I recommend option (b) as it's most differentiated. TAM: 20M US college students, SAM: 8M (40% smartphone users seeking productivity), SOM: 400K (5% adoption year 1). CAC target: $8, LTV target: $60 (12 months × $5/mo)."

**E-commerce Platform:**
"QUESTION: What is the competitive differentiation strategy?
(a) Lowest prices (commoditization, price war risk)
(b) Curated selection (niche focus, editorial voice)
(c) Fastest delivery (operational excellence, high costs)
(d) Best customer service (relationship-driven, retention focus)

I recommend option (b) as it's defensible and builds brand loyalty. Position as 'The thoughtful marketplace for [niche]' rather than competing with Amazon on price/speed."

## Marketing Frameworks

**TAM/SAM/SOM:**
```
TAM (Total Addressable Market): Total revenue if 100% market share
SAM (Serviceable Available Market): TAM constrained by your product's reach
SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market): Realistic market share in 1-3 years

Example:
- TAM: 20M college students × $60/year = $1.2B
- SAM: 8M students with smartphones seeking productivity = $480M
- SOM: 400K students (5% of SAM) = $24M year 1
```

**Positioning Statement:**
```
For [target customer]
Who [customer need]
Our [product/service]
Is a [category]
That [key benefit]
Unlike [competition]
We [differentiation]

Example:
For busy college students who struggle to balance academics, work, and social life,
TaskMaster is a smart task management app that learns your habits and priorities,
Unlike generic to-do apps, we provide AI-powered scheduling that adapts to your lifestyle.
```
